- Display your tech stack.
- Show your GitHub profile link.
- Share fun facts about yourself.

## Code Overview

The project contains a Profile class with the following methods:

- __init__(self, name, favorite_language, hobby, tech_stack, github_username, fun_fact): Initializes the profile attributes.
- introduce(self): Prints a self-introduction with name, favorite language, and hobby.
- show_stack(self): Prints the tech stack as a comma-separated list.

    my_profile = Profile(
        name="Solomon Tusingwire",
        favorite_language="Python",
        hobby="one hundred meter sprinting",
        tech_stack=["Python", "JavaScript", "Git", "MySQL"],
        github_username="Solomon200-alt",
        fun_fact="I can run a race in 12 seconds!"
    )

    my_profile.introduce()
    my_profile.show_stack()
    print("GitHub Profile:", my_profile.github_link())
    print("Fun Fact:", my_profile.fun_fact)
